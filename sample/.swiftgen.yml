## Note: all of the config entries below are just examples with placeholders. Be sure to edit and adjust to your needs when uncommenting.

## In case your config entries all use a common input/output parent directory, you can specify those here.
##   Every input/output paths in the rest of the config will then be expressed relative to these.
##   Those two top-level keys are optional and default to "." (the directory of the config file).
input_dir: iOSSDKExample/Supporting Files
output_dir: iOSSDKExample/Supporting Files/Generated


## Generate constants for your localized strings.
##   Be sure that SwiftGen only parses ONE locale (typically Base.lproj, or en.lproj, or whichever your development region is); otherwise it will generate the same keys multiple times.
##   SwiftGen will parse all `.strings` files found in that folder.
strings:
  inputs:
    - en.lproj
  outputs:
    - templateName: structured-swift5
      output: Strings+Generated.swift


## Generate constants for your Assets Catalogs, including constants for images, colors, ARKit resources, etc.
##   This example also shows how to provide additional parameters to your template to customize the output.
##   - Especially the `forceProvidesNamespaces: true` param forces to create sub-namespace for each folder/group used in your Asset Catalogs, even the ones without "Provides Namespace". Without this param, SwiftGen only generates sub-namespaces for folders/groups which have the "Provides Namespace" box checked in the Inspector pane.
##   - To know which params are supported for a template, use `swiftgen template doc xcassets swift5` to open the template documentation on GitHub.
xcassets:
  inputs:
    - Images.xcassets
  outputs:
    - templateName: swift5
      params:
        forceProvidesNamespaces: true
      output: XCAssets+Generated.swift


## Generate constants for your storyboards and XIBs.
##   This one generates 2 output files, one containing the storyboard scenes, and another for the segues.
##    (You can remove the segues entry if you don't use segues in your IB files).
##   For `inputs` we can use "." here (aka "current directory", at least relative to `input_dir` = "MyLib/Sources"),
##    and SwiftGen will recursively find all `*.storyboard` and `*.xib` files in there.
# ib:
#   inputs:
#     - .
#   outputs:
#     - templateName: scenes-swift5
#       output: IB-Scenes+Generated.swift
#     - templateName: segues-swift5
#       output: IB-Segues+Generated.swift


## There are other parsers available for you to use depending on your needs, for example:
##  - `fonts` (if you have custom ttf/ttc font files)
##  - `coredata` (for CoreData models)
##  - `json`, `yaml` and `plist` (to parse custom JSON/YAML/Plist files and generate code from their content)
## …
